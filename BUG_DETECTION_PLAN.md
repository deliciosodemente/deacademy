# Bug Detection and Edge Case Handling Plan

## Files Analyzed
- vite-api-middleware.js
- utils.js

---

## 1. vite-api-middleware.js

### Potential Bugs and Edge Cases
- **Filename Query Parameter Missing or Invalid**: Properly handled with 400 response, but ensure URL parsing is robust.
- **File Type Validation**: Only certain image types allowed; ensure mime type mapping is complete and consistent.
- **File Size Validation**: Max 4.5MB enforced; check if size calculation is accurate and consistent.
- **Environment Variable Check**: BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN must be set; consider fallback or clearer error messages.
- **Request Data Streaming**: Collecting chunks and concatenating buffers; potential issues if request stream errors or is interrupted.
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for size and token issues; ensure all other errors are logged and handled gracefully.
- **Response Headers**: Proper content-type and CORS headers set for feature flags; verify consistency for avatar upload responses.
- **Concurrency and Race Conditions**: Potential issues if multiple uploads happen simultaneously; consider locking or queueing if needed.

### Suggested Improvements
- Add timeout or max request size limit on incoming data stream to prevent DoS.
- Validate filename format more strictly to prevent path traversal or injection.
- Add unit tests for error cases and edge conditions.
- Ensure consistent CORS headers on all API responses.
- Log more detailed error context for easier debugging.

## 2. utils.js

### Potential Bugs and Edge Cases
- **Event Listener Management**: Dropdown event listeners added but not removed; potential memory leaks or duplicate handlers.
- **Async Auth Operations**: Login/logout/signup wrapped in try-catch; ensure UI state is always restored on error.
- **Button State Management**: Logout button disabled during operation; ensure no race conditions or stuck disabled state.
- **Toast Notifications**: Created dynamically and removed after timeout; verify no orphaned elements or style conflicts.
- **DOM Element Null Checks**: Some selectors may return null; ensure all DOM manipulations are guarded.
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard and focus management for dropdown; verify full keyboard navigation support.

### Suggested Improvements
- Remove event listeners on dropdown close or component unmount.
- Add debounce or throttle to prevent multiple rapid clicks on auth buttons.
- Add unit or integration tests for UI state transitions and error handling.
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and keyboard focus traps.
- Centralize toast management to prevent overlapping or excessive toasts.

---

## Dependent Files to Review
- components related to authentication UI and avatar upload.
- Other middleware or API route handlers for consistent error handling.

---

## Follow-up Steps
- Review and confirm plan with stakeholders.
- Implement fixes incrementally with tests.
- Perform manual and automated testing for edge cases.
- Monitor logs for runtime errors post-deployment.

This plan aims to improve robustness, user experience, and maintainability by addressing potential bugs and edge cases in critical middleware and UI utility code.
